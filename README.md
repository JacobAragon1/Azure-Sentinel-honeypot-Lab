# Azure-Sentinel-honeypot-Lab
 In this lab by Josh Madakor, I set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connected it to a live VM acting as a honeypot to observe real-time RDP brute force attacks from around the world. Weâ€™ll use a custom PowerShell script to find attackers' geolocations and plot them on the Azure Sentinel map.
